# Disclaimer

#### This project is an **independent, unofficial** software tool and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Xiaomi** or any of its subsidiaries.

## Purpose and Scope

This tool assists users in **discovering, comparing, tracking, and downloading** official Xiaomi firmware releases that are **publicly accessible** on Xiaomi-operated websites or content delivery networks.

It automates tasks that a knowledgeable user could otherwise perform manually in a standard web browser, **without requiring authentication, credentials, or special permissions** from Xiaomi or any third party.

The application is intended as a **helper utility for power users**, designed to streamline lookup, comparison, and retrieval workflows. It is **not designed for malicious, abusive, or harmful use**, does not attempt to access private or restricted resources, and does not collect, extract, or compromise information beyond what is already publicly available.

The tool is intended to operate conservatively and respectfully, with the goal of reducing manual effort—not exploiting, interfering with, or impairing Xiaomi’s services or infrastructure.

- **Use outside officially provided or authorized access methods**  
  The Agreement states that Platform services should be accessed via official Xiaomi applications, official webpages, or other methods explicitly authorized by Xiaomi.

- **Enforcement at Xiaomi’s discretion**  
  The Agreement grants Xiaomi broad discretion to restrict, suspend, or terminate access if it believes a user’s behavior violates the Agreement or related policies, regardless of intent or scale of use.
